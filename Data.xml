		<li>Nominal - Mutually Exclusive and Exhaustive categories for which the numerical value has only identification
		significance. Ex: Male = 1, Female = -1</li>
		<li>Ordinal - Discrete values ranked from lowest to highest or vice versa. Ex: Class grades for GPA.</li>
		<li>Interval - Ordinal data where distance between data values is of significance. Ex: Heights and Weights.</li>
		<li>Ratio - Interval data where ratios of observations have meaning. Ex: Percentile rankings</li>

<title>Measures of the Middle</title>

<p>
Defn: Suppose X is a discrete random variable with range R = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and pmf f(x). In general:
The arithmetic mean is a measure of the middle
μ = x1f(x1) + ... + xnf(xn) = ∑ .
=
n
k
kk xfx
1
)(
The mean is often called the centroid in the sense that if the xk were locations of objects of weight f(xk), then the centroid
would be the point where this system of n masses would balance. 
</p>

<p>
Other Means:
• Geometric Mean = (x1 x2 … xn)
1/n
• Harmonic Mean =

<title>Measures of Spread</title>


<p>Measures of spread:
• Average Deviation from the Mean – always zero for any distribution
• Average Absolute Deviation from the Mean – difficult to deal with algebra when absolute values are used
• Average Squared Deviation from the Mean – always non-negative and good with algebra and calculus 
</p>

<definition><title>Variance</title>
<statement>The variance is a measure of spread found by using the average squared deviation from the mean

if this value exists and is also denoted by Var(X). The positive square root of the variance is called the standard deviation
and is denoted by σ. </statement>
