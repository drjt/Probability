    <title>Regression</title>

<section><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
Given two distinct points, there is one line which passes exactly through both.  Indeed, if the points are <m>(x_0,y_0), (x_0,y_0)</m> then presuming the x-values are different gives the equation
<me> y = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}(x - x_0) + y_0</me>
is the linear function which passes through both points.  If the x's are equal then 
<me> x = x_0</me>
is your linear equation. 
However, once you collect three or more points it is likely that there is no line which exactly "interpolates" all of the points.

In this chapter, you will investigate how to create polynomial functions which in some manner approximate a collection of data point in some "best" manner.
