    <title>Hypothesis Testing</title>

<section><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
When creating confidence intervals, you started with a sample and used the sample statistic (sample mean, relative frequency, sample variance, etc.) to anchor an interval which (with high possibility) contains the corresponding population statistic <m>\mu, p, \sigma^2</m>, etc. In this section, we instead start with an educated guess for one of the population statistics <m>\mu, p, \sigma^2</m> and then statistically compare that value with the subsequently collected sample statistic.
</p>
<p>
The educated guess noted above is often called the "null hypothesis" and should be considered as a guess that one tries to disprove if possible by using a subsequent statistical sample.

Discussion on Type 1 and Type 2 errors.
