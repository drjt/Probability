<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>People often make claims about being the biggest, best, most often recommended, etc. One sometimes even believes these claims. In this class, we will attempt to determine if such claims are reasonable by first introducing probability from a semi rigorous mathematical viewpoint using concepts developed in Calculus. We will use this framework to carefully discuss making such statistical inferences as above and in general to obtain accurate knowledge even when the known data is not complete. </p><span class="incontext"><a href="RelativeFrequency.html#p-145">in-context</a></span>
