<p>Consider a deck of 52 standard playing cards and a success occurs when a Heart is selected from the deck. 
	When extracting one card randomly, the probability
	of that card being a Heart is then P(Heart) = 13/52. Now, assume that one card has already been extracted and set
	aside.  Now, 
	prepare to extract another. If the first card drawn was a Heart, then there are only 12 Hearts left for the 
	second draw. However, if the first card drawn was not a Heart, then there are 13 Hearts available for the second
	draw. To compute this probability correctly, one need to formulate the question so that subadditivity can 
	be utilized.</p>
<p>
	To do this, consider 
	P(Heart on 2nd draw) 
	= P( [Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw] \(\cup\) [Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw] )
	= P(Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw ) + P(Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw )
	= | Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw | / | Number of ways to get two cards |
	+ | Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw / | Number of ways to get two cards |
	= (13 12) / (52 51) + (39 13) / (52 51) = 12 / (4 51) + (3 13) / ( 4 51) =
