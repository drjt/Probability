<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The combined accuracy rate for the screen to detect the chromosomal abnormalities mentioned above is approximately 85% with a false positive rate of 5%. This means that (from <a class="external-url" href="http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/first-trimester-screen/" target="_blank">americanpregnancy.org</a>)
	<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-136">Approximately 85 out of every 100 babies affected by the abnormalities addressed by the screen will be identified. (Positive Positive)</li>
<li id="li-137">Approximately 5% of all normal pregnancies will receive a positive result or an abnormal level. (False Positive)</li>
</ul>
	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-138">Given that your test came back negative, determine the likelihood that the child will actually have spinal bifida.</li>
<li id="li-139">Given that your test came back negative, determine the likelihood that the child will not have spina bifida</li>
<li id="li-140">Given that a positive test means you have a 1/100 to 1/300 chance of experiencing one of the abnormalities, determine the likelihood of spinal bifida in a randomly selected child.</li>
