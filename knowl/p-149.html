1.  Pick two cards without replacement one after the other from this deck and determine the following number of possible outcomes:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-85">The number of ways to get an Ace for both cards.</li>
<li id="li-86">The number of ways to get an Ace for only one of the two cards.</li>
<li id="li-87">The number of ways to get an Ace on the first draw and a Spade on the second draw.</li>
</ul>
2.  Pick five cards without replacement one after the other from a newly shuffled full deck and determine the following number of possible outcomes:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-88">All cards have different faces</li>
<li id="li-89">"A pair". That is, two cards have the same face but the others are from three other faces.</li>
<li id="li-90">"Three of a kind".  That is, three cards have the same face but the others are from two other faces.</li>
<li id="li-91">"Two Pair". That is, two cards come from one face, two other cards come from a common face that is not the same as the first two cards, and the last card comes from some other face.</li>
<li id="li-92">"Full House". That is, three cards have the same face and the other two come from a common face that is not the same as the first three cards.</li>
<li id="li-93">"Four of a Kind". That is, four cards have the same face and the other card comes from some other face.</li>
<li id="li-94">"Flush". That is, the five cards for a sequence in order of adjacent faces in the original list and from the same suit.</li>
<li id="li-95">"Royal Flush". That is, a flush but only with the cards {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10}.</li>
</ul>
