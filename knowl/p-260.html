In creating these point estimates repeatedly, you have noticed that the results will change somewhat over time. Indeed, flip a coin 20 times and you might expect 10 heads. However, in practice it is likely to 9 or 12 out of 20 and possible to get any of the other possible outcomes. This natural variation makes the point estimates noted above to almost certainly be in error. However one would expect that they should be close and the Central Limit Theorem does indicate that the distribution of sample means should be approximately normally distributed. Thus, instead of relying just on the value of the point estimate, you might want to investigate a way to determine a reasonable interval centered on the sample statistic in which you have some confidence the actual population statistic should belong. This leads to a discussion of interval estimates known as confidence intervals (using calculational tools) and statistical tolerance intervals (using order statistics).
