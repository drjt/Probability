		Relative frequency gives a way to measure the proportion of "successful" outcomes when doing an experimental approach. From the interactive applications above, it appears that the relative frequency does jump around as the experiment is repeated but that the amount of variation decreases as the number of experiments increases. This is known to be true in general and leads to what is known as the "Law of Large Numbers". We would like to formalize what these relative frequencies seem to be approaching and will call this theoretical limit the "probability" of the outcome. In doing so, we will do our best to model our definition so that it follow the behavior of relative frequency.
