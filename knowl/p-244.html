<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>To motivate this discussion, consider the following two interactive experiments.  For the first graph below, a sequence of N random samples, each of size r, ranging from 0 to "Range" is generated and graphed as small data points.  As the number of samples N and the sample size r increase, notice that the data seems to cover the entire range of possible values relatively uniformly.  (For this scatter plot note that each row represents the data for one sample of size r.  The larger the N, the greater the number of rows.)  Each row is averaged and that mean value is plotted on the graph as a red circle.  If you check the "Show_Mean" box, the mean of these circles is indicated by the green line in the middle of the plot.
