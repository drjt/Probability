For the second graph below, the means are collected and the relative frequency of each is plotted.  As N increases, you should see that the results begin to show an interesting tendency.   As you increase the data range, you may notice this graph has a larger number of data values.  Smoothing groups this data into intervals of length two for perhaps a graph with less variability.
