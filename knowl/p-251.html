Often, when one wants to solve various scientific problems, several assumptions will be made regarding the nature of the underlying setting and base their conclusions on those assumptions.  Indeed, if one is going to use a Binomial Distribution or a Negative Binomial Distribution, an assumption on the value of p is necessary.  For Poisson and Exponential Distributions, one must know the mean.  For Normal Distributions, one must assume values for both the mean and the standard deviation.   Where do these values come from?  Often, one may perform a preliminary study and obtain a sample statistic...such as a sample mean or a relative frequency and use these values for Î¼ or p.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#p-251">in-context</a></span>
