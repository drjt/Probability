You should have noticed by now that repeatedly sampling from a given distribution will yield a variety of sample statistics such as \(\overline{x}\) as an estimate perhaps for the population mean \(\mu\) or \(\frac{Y}{n}\) as an estimate for the population likelihood of success p. In this section, you will see how these sample "point estimators" are actually the best possible choices.
