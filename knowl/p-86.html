<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>As you considered the measures of the center and spread before, each data point was considered individually. Often, data may however be grouped into categories and perhaps expressed as a frequency distribution. In this case, rather than considering \(x_k\) to be the kth data value can take advantage of the grouping to perhaps save a bit on arithmetic.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-9.html#p-86">in-context</a></span>
