Consider each of the following:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-137">
As N increases with single digit values of r, what appears to happen to the mean and range of the means?  How does increasing the data range from 1-100 to 1-200 or 1-300 affect these results?</li>
<li id="li-138">As N increases (say, for a middle value of r), what appears to happen to the means?  How does increasing the data range from 1-100 to 1-200 or 1-300 affect these results?</li>
<li id="li-139">As r increases (say, for a middle value of N), what appears to happen to the range of the averages?  Does your conclusion actually depend upon the value of N?  (Look at the graph and don't worry about the actual numerical values.)
How does increasing N for the second graph affect the skewness and kurtosis of that graph?  Do things change significantly as r is increased?  </li>
</ul>
