<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>To investigate these terms and to motivate our discussion of probability, consider flipping coins using the
interactive cell below. Notice in this case, the sample space S = {Heads, Tails} and the random experiment consists
of flipping a fair coin one time. Each trial results in either a Head or a Tail. Since we are measuring both Heads
and Tails then we will not worry about which is a success or failure. Further, on each flip the outcomes of Heads
or Tails are mutually exclusive events. We count the frequencies and compute the relative frequencies for a varying
number of trials selected by you as you move the slider bar. Results are displayed using a histogram.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="RelativeFrequency.html#p-110">in-context</a></span>
