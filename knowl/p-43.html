<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Using the data set {2,5,8,10} with n=4 values, the 25th percentile is computed by considering 
		\((n+1)p = (4+1)0.25 = 5/4 = 1.25\).  
		So, m = 1 and r = 0.25. Therefore 
		\(P^{0.25} = 0.75 \times 2 + 0.25 \times 5 = 2.75\) 
		as noted above. You can see that 3 also lies in this same range and has the same percentages above and below. However, it would be a slightly larger percentile value. Indeed, going backward:
		\begin{gather*}
3 = (1-r) \times 2 + r \times 5\\
\Rightarrow r = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow (n+1)p = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\\
\Rightarrow p = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267
\end{gather*}
		and so 3 would actually be at approximately the 26.7th percentile.
