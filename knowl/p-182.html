<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>It is important to notice that not all outcomes are equally likely--even in times when there are only two of them. Indeed, it is generally not an equally likely situation when picking the winner of a football game which pits, say, the New Orleans Saints professional football team with the New Orleans Home School Saints. Even though there are only two options the probability of the professional team winning is much greater than the chances that the high school will prevail.
