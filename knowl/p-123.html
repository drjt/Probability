		In this case, the order of the characters matters but all of the 
		characters are distinct. Since we have 9 characters provided, the we can
		consider each character as an event with the first event as a choice
		from the 9, the second event as a choice from the remaining 8, etc. This
		gives \(9 \times 8 \ times ... \times 1 = 362880\) possible 
		passphrases.
