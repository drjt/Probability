Defn: Suppose X is a discrete random variable with range R = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and pmf f(x). In general:
The arithmetic mean is a measure of the middle
μ = x1f(x1) + ... + xnf(xn) = ∑ .

)(
The mean is often called the centroid in the sense that if the xk were locations of objects of weight f(xk), then the centroid
would be the point where this system of n masses would balance.
