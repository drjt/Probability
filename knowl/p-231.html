<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Blaise Pascal was a 	17th century mathematician and philosopher who was accomplished in many areas but may likely be best known to you for his creation of what is now known as Pascal's Triangle. As part of his philosophical pursuits, he proposed what is known as "Pascal's wager". It suggests two  mutually exclusive outcomes: that God exists or that he does not. His argument is that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas they stand to receive infinite gains as represented by eternity in Heaven and avoid an infinite losses of eternity in Hell. This type of reasoning is part of what is known as "decision theory".
