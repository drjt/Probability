	D. In this problem, you want to consider how many people are necessary in order to have an even chance of finding two or more who share a common birthday. Toward that end, assuming a year has exactly 365 equally likely days let r be the number of people in a sample and consider the following:
	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-124">Determine the number of different outcomes of birthdays when order matters and birthdays are allowed to be repeated.</li>
<li id="li-125">Determine the number of different outcomes when birthdays are not allowed to be repeated.</li>
<li id="li-126">Determine the probability that two or more of your r students have the same birthday.</li>
<li id="li-127">Prepare a spreadsheet with the probabilities found above from r=2 to r=50. Determine the value of r for which this probability is closest to 0.5.</li>
<li id="li-128">As best as you can, sample two groups of the size found above and gather birthday information. For each group, determine if there is a shared birthday or not.  Compare your results with others in the class to check whether the sampling validates that about half of the samples should have a shared birthday group.</li>
</ol>
