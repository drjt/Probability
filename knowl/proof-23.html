<p>First, convert the problem to a slightly different form:</p>\( \frac{1}{(a+b)^n} = \frac{1}{b^n} \frac{1}{(\frac{a}{b}+1)^n} 
						 = \frac{1}{b^n} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^k \binom{n + k - 1}{k} \left ( \frac{a}{b} \right ) ^k}
			\)<p>So, let's replace \(\frac{a}{b} = x\) and ignore for a while the term factored out. Then, we only need to show </p>\begin{gather*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^k \binom{n + k - 1}{k} x^k} = \left ( \frac{1}{1+x} \right )^n 
\end{gather*}<p>However</p>\begin{align*}
 \left ( \frac{1}{1+x} \right )^n &amp; = \left ( \frac{1}{1 - (-x)} \right )^n \\
 &amp; = \left ( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^k x^k} \right )^n
\end{align*}<p>This infinite sum raised to a power can be expanded by distributing terms in the standard way. 
			In doing so, the various powers of x multiplied together
			will create a series in powers of x involving \(x^0, x^1, x^2, ...\).  
			To detemine the final coefficients notice that the number of time \(m^k\) will 
			appear in this product depends upon the number of ways one can write k as a sum of nonnegative integers.</p>
<p>For example, the coefficient of \(x^3\) will come from the n ways of multiplying the coefficients 
			\(x^3, x^0, ..., x^0\) and \(x^2, x^1, x^0, ..., x^0\)
			 and \(x^1, x^1, x^1, x^0,..., x^0\). This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write the 
			 number k as a sum of nonnegative integers. The possible set of
			 nonnegative integers is {0,1,2,...,k} and one way to count the combinations is to separate k *'s by n-1 |'s.  
			 For example, if k = 3 then *||** means 
			 \(x^1 x^0 x^2 = x^3\). Similarly for k = 5 and |**|*|**| implies \( x^0 x^2 x^1 x^2 x^0 = x^5\). 
			 The number of ways to interchange the identical *'s among the
			 idential |'s is \(\binom{n+k-1}{k}\). </p>
<p>Furthermore, to obtain an even power of x will require an even number of odd powers and an odd power of x 
			 will require an odd number of odd powers. So, the 
			 coefficient of the odd terms stays odd and the coefficient of the even terms remains even. Therefore,</p>\begin{gather*}
 \left ( \frac{1}{1+x} \right )^n = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^k \binom{n + k - 1}{k} x^k}
\end{gather*}<p>Similarly,</p>\( \left ( \frac{1}{1-x} \right )^n = \left ( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {x^k} \right )^n = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {\binom{n + k - 1}{k} x^k}\)</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-29.html#proof-23">in-context</a></span>
