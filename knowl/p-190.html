	Consider a deck of 52 standard playing cards and a success occurs when a Heart is selected from the deck. When extracting one card randomly, the probability	of that card being a Heart is then P(Heart) = 13/52. Now, assume that one card has already been extracted and setaside.  Now, prepare to extract another. If the first card drawn was a Heart, then there are only 12 Hearts left for the second draw. However, if the first card drawn was not a Heart, then there are 13 Hearts available for the second draw. To compute this probability correctly, one need to formulate the question so that subadditivity can  be utilized.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-19.html#p-190">in-context</a></span>
