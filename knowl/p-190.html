<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>When finding the probability of an event, sometimes you may need to consider past history and how it might affect things. Indeed, you might think that when the local station forecasts rain than it the probability of it actually raining should be greater than if they forecast fair skies. At least that is the hope. :)  In this section, you will develop a way to deal with the probability of some event that might change dependent upon the occurence or not of some other event.
