<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Consider the situation where one can observe a sequence  of n
	independent trials with the likelihood of a 
	success on each individual trial stays constant from trial to trial.
	Call this likelihood the probably of "success" and 
	denote its value by 
	\(p\) where \( 0 \lt p \lt 1 \).  
	If we let the variable \(X\) measure the number of successes 
	obtained when doing a fixed number of trials n, then the resulting
	distribution of probabilities is called a Binomial Distribution.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="BinomialDistribution.html#p-159">in-context</a></span>
