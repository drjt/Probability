<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Notice, not only are the answers not the same but they are not even close. To understand why this 
	is different from the examples before, consider the possible outcomes from each pair of die. Since we
	are measuring the sum of the dice then (for a pair of standard 6-sided dice) the possible sums are from 
	2 to 12. However, there is only one way to get a 2--namely from a (1,1) pair--while there are 6 ways to get
	a 7--namely from the pairs (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1). So it might make some sense
	that the likelihood of getting a 7 is 6 times larger than that of getting a 2. Check to see if that
	is the case with your experiment above.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="RelativeFrequency.html#p-148">in-context</a></span>
