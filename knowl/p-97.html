<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Stem-and-Leaf Plot - Histogram with data. Using the state population data above, consider organizing the data but using a "two-pass sort" where you first roughly break data up into groups based upon ranges which relate to their first digit(s). In this case, let's break up into groups according to populations corresponding to 0-4 million, 5-9 million, 10-14 million, 15-19, million, 20-24 million, 25-29 million, 30-35 million, and 35-39 million. We can represent these classes by using the stems 0L, 0H, 1L, 1H, 2L, 2H, 3L, and 3H where the L and H represent the one's digits L in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and H in {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.  Once we group the data into these smaller groups then we can write the remaining portion of the number horizontally as leaves (in this case with one decimal place for all values.) This gives a step-and-leaf plot. If we additionally sort the data in the leaves then this gives you an ordered stem-and-leaf plot. For the state population data, the ordered stem-and-leaf plot is given by

Notice how it is easy to now see that most state populations are relatively small and that there are relatively few states with larger population. Also, notice that you can use this plot to relatively easily identify minimum, maximum, and other order statistics.
