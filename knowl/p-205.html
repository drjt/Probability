<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Consider the situation where one can observe a sequence  of independent
	trials where the likelihood of a success on each individual trial
	stays constant from trial to trial. Call this likelihood the probably of
	"success" and denote its value by \(p\) 
	where \( 0 \lt p \lt 1 \).  
	If we let the variable \(X\) measure the number of trials needed in order
	to obtain the rth success, \(r \ge 1\) 
	then the resulting distribution of probabilities is called a 
	Geometric Distribution.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-24.html#p-205">in-context</a></span>
