	B. Congratulations...your family is having a baby! As part of the prenatal care, some testing is part of the normal procedure including one for spinal bifida (which is a condition in which part of the spinal cord may be exposed.) Indeed, measurement of maternal serum AFP values is a standard tool used in obstetrical care to identify pregnancies that may have an increased risk for this disorder. You want to make plans for the new child's care and want to know how serious to take the test results. However, some times the test indicates that the child has the disorder when in actuality it does not (a false positive) and likewise may indicate that the child does not have the disorder when in fact it does (a false negative.)
