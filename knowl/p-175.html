	To do this, consider 
	P(Heart on 2nd draw) 
	= P( [Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw] \(\cup\) [Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw] )
	= P(Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw ) + P(Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw )
	= | Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw | / | Number of ways to get two cards |
	+ | Not Heart on 1st draw \(\cap\) Heart on 2nd draw / | Number of ways to get two cards |
	= (13 12) / (52 51) + (39 13) / (52 51) = 12 / (4 51) + (3 13) / ( 4 51) =
