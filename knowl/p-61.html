<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Mathematics generally focuses on providing precise answers with absolute certainty. For example, solving an equation generates specific (and non-varying) solutions. Statistics on the other hand deals with providing precise answers to questions when there is uncertainty. It might seem impossible to provide such precise answers but the focus of this text is to show how that can be done so long as the questions are properly posed and the answers properly interpreted.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="RelativeFrequency.html#p-61">in-context</a></span>
