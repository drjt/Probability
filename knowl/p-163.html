<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In general, this suggests a rule: if there are n outcomes and each one has the same
	chance of occurring on a given trial then on average on a large number of trials the relative
	frequency of that outcome is 1/n.
	In general, if a number of outcomes are "equally likely" then this is a good model for measuring
	the proportion of outcomes that would be expected to have any given outcome. However, it is not
	always true that outcomes are equally likely. Consider rolling two die and measuring their sum:</p><span class="incontext"><a href="RelativeFrequency.html#p-163">in-context</a></span>
