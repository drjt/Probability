<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>In the 2004 movie "National Treasure" Ben and Riley are attempting 
		to guess Abagail's password to enter the room with the Declaration. 
		They are able
		to determine the passphrase to get into the vault room by doing a scan
		that detects the buttons pushed (not due to chocolate but just due to 
		the natural oils on fingers). They notice that the buttons pushed 
		include the characters AEFGLORVY.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-10.html#p-91">in-context</a></span>
