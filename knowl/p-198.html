<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>For example, the coefficient of \(x^3\) will come from the n ways of multiplying the coefficients 
			\(x^3, x^0, ..., x^0\) and \(x^2, x^1, x^0, ..., x^0\)
			 and \(x^1, x^1, x^1, x^0,..., x^0\). This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write the 
			 number k as a sum of nonnegative integers. The possible set of
			 nonnegative integers is {0,1,2,...,k} and one way to count the combinations is to separate k *'s by n-1 |'s.  
			 For example, if k = 3 then *||** means 
			 \(x^1 x^0 x^2 = x^3\). Similarly for k = 5 and |**|*|**| implies \( x^0 x^2 x^1 x^2 x^0 = x^5\). 
			 The number of ways to interchange the identical *'s among the
			 idential |'s is \(\binom{n+k-1}{k}\). </p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-22.html#p-198">in-context</a></span>
