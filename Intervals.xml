    <title>Estimating Data using Intervals</title>

<section>	
	<title>Chebyshev</title>

	<p>An interval centered on the mean in which at least a certain proportion
	of the actual data must lie.

	<title>Chebyshev's Theorem</title>
	<statement>
	Given a random variable X with given mean μ and standard deviation σ, for k>1 at least
	2
	1 1
	k − of the observations lie within k standard deviations from the mean.
	</statement>

<title>Measures of Spread</title>


<p>Measures of spread:
• Average Deviation from the Mean – always zero for any distribution
• Average Absolute Deviation from the Mean – difficult to deal with algebra when absolute values are used
• Average Squared Deviation from the Mean – always non-negative and good with algebra and calculus 
</p>

<definition><title>Variance</title>
<statement>The variance is a measure of spread found by using the average squared deviation from the mean

and is denoted by σ. </statement>
